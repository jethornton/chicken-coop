All we have to do is tell Raspbian to look at "card #1" for the default audio.
Card #0 is the built in audio, so this is fairly straightforward.

sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf

defaults.ctl.card 0

defaults.pcm.card 0

Change both “0” to “1” and then save the file. That’s it!

wpasupplicant (2:2.6-19) unstable; urgency=medium

  With this release, wpasupplicant no longer respects the system
  default minimum TLS version, defaulting to TLSv1.0, not TLSv1.2. If
  you're sure you will never connect to EAP networks requiring anything less
  than 1.2, add this to your wpasupplicant configuration:

    tls_disable_tlsv1_0=1
    tls_disable_tlsv1_1=1

  wpasupplicant also defaults to a security level 1, instead of the system
  default 2. Should you need to change that, change this setting in your
  wpasupplicant configuration:

    openssl_ciphers=DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2

  Unlike wpasupplicant, hostapd still respects system defaults.
