All we have to do is tell Raspbian to look at "card #1" for the default audio.
Card #0 is the built in audio, so this is fairly straightforward.

sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
and look for the following two lines:

defaults.ctl.card 0

defaults.pcm.card 0

Change both “0” to “1” and then save the file. That’s it!

To fix the issue of libEGL being renamed in Debian 10

sudo ln -s libbrcmGLESv2.so libGLESv2.so
